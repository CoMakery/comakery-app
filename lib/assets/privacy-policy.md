In connection with potential transfers of Coins between you and a third party, including merchants, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number which may be used to inform you that a transfer has been sent to or received from the third party. We may use this information in connection with such transfers to confirm that you are a CoMakery customer, that transfers of Coins are enabled, and/or to notify you that you have received Coins. If you request that we validate your status as a CoMakery customer with a third party, we will do so. You may also choose to send Coins to or request Coins from an email address.

If you authorize one or more third-party applications to access your CoMakery account, then information you have provided to CoMakery may be shared with those third parties. Unless you provide further authorization, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using CoMakery services.

##**HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES**

We may share your personal information with:

- Third party identity verification services in order to prevent fraud. This allows CoMakery to confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other third party databases. These service providers may create derivative data based on your personal information that can be used solely in connection with provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services;
- Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations such as bill collection, marketing, and technology services. Our contracts require these service providers to only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us, and prohibit them from selling your information to anyone else;
- Financial institutions with which we partner;
- Companies or other entities that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy;
